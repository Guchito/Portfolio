# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with React and JavaScript.

## Game Description

This is a basic implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where two players, X and O, take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Gameplay

* The game starts with an empty grid.
* Player X makes the first move, clicking on an empty square to place their mark (X).
* Player O makes their move by clicking on an empty square to place their mark (O).
* Players alternate turns.
* If a player gets three in a row, they win the game.
* If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## Features

* Simple and intuitive gameplay
* 3x3 grid for classic Tic Tac Toe experience
* Two-player support (X and O)

## Technical Details

* Built with React and JavaScript
* No external libraries or dependencies
* Purely client-side implementation
